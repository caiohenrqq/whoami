          My name is Caio Henrique de Oliveira Santana, and I'm 21 years old.
          Born and raised in Ji-Paraná, Rondônia, Brazil—a small city far from
          tech hubs—but one that shaped how I approach problems. I had to figure
          things out myself most of the time because opportunities were limited
          here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teen years were rough beyond the regular stuff everyone deals with.
          Between 14 and 20, I fought two different cancers back-to-back.
          Everything changed really fast. Hospitals became routine, and
          discipline wasn’t optional anymore, it was life-or-death.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the second cancer, I received a bone marrow transplant
          <a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">(bone marrow transplant)</a
          > from my brother, a gift that turned things around. I came out of that
          mess more stubborn about not quitting, no matter what gets thrown my way,
          and after that, things finally started to go right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tech always pulled me in, though. Even when school math classes
          weren’t cutting it, self-taught programming became my thing. I spent
          hours building, breaking, and fixing projects. Learning by doing stuck
          as my default mode for anything code-related.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          I started with basic websites, then moved to full systems over time. I
          got comfortable with React and TypeScript on the frontend, and Laravel
          with MySQL on the backend. I dug deeper into what really matters in
          tech: the foundations of computer science. Fundamentals over
          frameworks always mattered more—that mindset stuck through every
          project.
        </p>

        <p>
          At BuscaSim, working full-stack taught me scale. I built features that
          actually moved metrics, like an A/B testing engine using flow-based
          logic, which gave the company new flexibility, and an API integration
          layer handling multiple external services via strategy patterns.
          Seeing real user impact teaches responsibility in a way theoretical
          knowledge never could.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree now, filling gaps from those
          "lost" teenage years. I’m focused on math, algorithms, and database
          design—not just for grades, but to build a proper foundation. I want
          that bedrock knowledge for long-term career growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m still game-obsessed deep down. I once wanted a pro esports career
          in CS:GO or Fortnite. It didn’t pan out, but that competitive drive
          shifted to coding. I treat programming like a sport now—with the same
          hunger to improve, constantly pushing past average.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          These days I balance work, studies, and physical recovery. I follow a
          structured routine for fitness, nutrition, and sleep. No crazy
          extremes—just consistency. Same approach as debugging code:
          incremental progress daily. I push slightly further each day, whether
          in the gym, the code editor, or the math textbook.
        </p>

        <p>
          My story isn’t only tech specs—it’s stubbornness and refusing to stay
          down. From a small-town kid in Brazil to shipping production systems,
          I proved limitations can fuel you when you let them. And yeah, this is
          definitely just chapter one.
        </p>

          I hope that small piece of my history really helps you.
