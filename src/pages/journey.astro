          My name is Caio Henrique de Oliveira Santana, I’m 21 years old. Born
          and raised in Ji-Paraná, Rondônia, far from the big tech hubs, and
          that shaped the way I solve problems. Many times, I had to figure
          things out on my own because opportunities around here were rare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teenage years were tough, beyond the usual challenges everyone goes
          through. Between 14 and 20, I fought two cancers in a row. Everything
          happened really fast: hospitals became routine, and discipline stopped
          being a choice, it was survival.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the second treatment, I received a <a
            href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854"
            class="transition-colors inline-block font-bold hover:bg-accent hover:text-text text-sm sm:text-base underline"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">bone marrow transplant</a
          > from my brother, a gift that changed everything. I came out of that stage
          even more stubborn about not giving up. From that point on, things finally
          started to move forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even with gaps left by school math, technology always called me. Being
          self-taught in programming became a passion: hours spent building,
          breaking, and fixing projects. Learning by doing became my default for
          anything related to code.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          I focus on what really matters: the fundamentals of computer science.
          For me, a solid foundation comes before frameworks, and that mindset
          guides every project I work on.
        </p>

        <p>
          At BuscaSim, working full-stack taught me a lot about scalability. I
          built features that actually moved metrics: an A/B testing engine with
          flow-based logic, giving the company more flexibility, and an API
          integration layer handling multiple external services with the
          Strategy Pattern. Seeing real user impact teaches responsibility in a
          way pure theory never does.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          Today I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree and filling in the gaps
          from those “lost” years. I try to focus on the core areas of tech, the
          basics that most frameworks try to abstract away more and more. I’m
          doing this because I want a truly solid base, and honestly, I really
          enjoy it too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deep down, I’m still obsessed with games. I once wanted to be a pro
          player in CS:GO or Fortnite, but… it didn’t happen. Still, that
          competitive spirit migrated to code. I take programming seriously:
          constant practice, continuous improvement, always looking for the next
          step.
        </p>

        <div class="h-px bg-neutral-200"></div>

        <p>
          Today I balance work, studies, and physical recovery. I stick to a
          steady routine of training, nutrition, and sleep. No extremes, just
          consistency. Every day I move a little further, whether at the gym, in
          books, or hands-on practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, my story isn’t just about stack or being some kind of code
          genius. It’s about stubbornness and refusing to stay down. I’m simply
          obsessed with what I do, and that’s what’s been pushing me this far.
          Of course, this is only the first chapter.
        </p>
