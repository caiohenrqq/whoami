          My name is Caio Henrique de Oliveira Santana, born and raised in
          Ji-Paraná, a city in the interior of Rondônia, Brazil. Growing up here
          meant being far from the large tech centers, but it also shaped me
          into someone resourceful and persistent. With limited access to
          opportunities, I had to teach myself most of the things that sparked
          my curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
          My teenage years were marked by challenges that went far beyond school
          and computers. Between the ages of fifteen and twenty, I was forced to
          confront two different cancers. Those years changed me completely. The
          hospital became a second home, and discipline wasn’t just a good
          habit—it was survival. The experience left me resilient, patient, and
          unwilling to give up, no matter the size of the obstacle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite these difficulties, I always felt drawn to technology. Even
          when my math education in school wasn’t solid, I refused to let that
          stop me. I spent hours learning programming by myself, building small
          projects, breaking things, and then fixing them. That habit of
          learning by doing became the foundation of who I am as a developer
          today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I evolved from experimenting with simple websites to
          building complete systems. I became comfortable with React and
          TypeScript on the frontend and Laravel with MySQL on the backend. I
          pushed myself to understand how things actually work under the
          surface: SQL queries, algorithms, data structures, HTTP. I believe
          strong fundamentals matter more than flashy frameworks, and I keep
          coming back to that idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professionally, I grew into a full-stack role at BuscaSim, a platform
          with hundreds of thousands of daily users. I built features that
          actually moved the needle, like a flow-based A/B testing engine that
          gave the company a new level of flexibility, and an integration layer
          that connected multiple external APIs using a strategy-pattern
          architecture. Seeing my work impact real users and measurable results
          taught me the true meaning of responsibility in software engineering.

        <p>
          At the same time, I’ve been pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer
          Science. Studying formally has helped me fill the gaps I left behind
          during my teenage years, especially in mathematics and computer
          science fundamentals. Today, I study subjects like discrete math,
          algorithms, and database design, not just to pass exams but to build
          the solid foundation I want for my career.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside work and study, I’ve never lost the love for games. As a
          teenager, I dreamed of becoming a professional CS:GO or Fortnite
          player. It didn’t happen, but that drive to compete and improve found
          a new outlet in coding. I now approach programming with the same
          passion I once had for esports—driven, curious, and never satisfied
          with being average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I balance my time between working, studying, and rebuilding my
          physical health after years of treatment. I have a structured routine
          for fitness, nutrition, and sleep. It’s not about extremes—it’s about
          consistency, just like coding. Every day I push a little further,
          whether that’s in my body, my mind, or my projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          My story is not just about code. It’s about resilience, persistence,
          and choosing to create even when the odds are against me. From a small
          city in Rondônia to building large-scale systems for real companies,
          I’ve proven to myself that limitations can become fuel. And I know
          that this is just the beginning.
